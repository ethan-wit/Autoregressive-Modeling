# Autoregressive-Modeling

An Autoregresive model predicts future values using a series of past values. It accomplishes this by optimizing regressor (past value) parameters through minimizing an objective function.

A Multi-Objective Autoregressive model predicts future values using multiple series of past values. It accomplishes this by optimizing regressor (past value) parameters through minimizing a weighted sum of many objective functions.

A Multi-Objective Autoregressive model may have utility in forecasting time series that are generated by the same process, but the process has intervals of inactivity. Examples may be output from a manufacturing process that only runs 6:00am-8:00pm, or asset prices on an exchange where trading only occurs 9:30am-4:00pm.
